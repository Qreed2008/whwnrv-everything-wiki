<h1>Numbered versions</h1>
<p>Applies to all OSes</p>
<p>ex. <a href="Windows 1.0">Windows 1.01</a>, <a href="Windows 2.0">Windows 2.03</a>, <a href="MacOS 8.0">MacOS 8.0</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows has 2 timelines, I nickname the other one "<a href="Windows 100.09">100.09</a>" considering that's the first version that was made in the alt timeline</p>
