<ul>
  <li>For eras that use + (ex. EEE+), a few others can be used also: √, ÷, -, *, and ^. They can be used in conjunction with each other, like "EEE^*+--". There's also a condensed form that can be used from 10 of a character and up (ex. MMR[+10] ).</li>
  <li>For all eras, there is "Before" and "After" eras (ex. BBBC). This also has a very similar condensed form (ex. [10B]BC).</li>
