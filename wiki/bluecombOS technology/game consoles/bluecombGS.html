<p>bluecombGS (previously Q-GS and codenamed MAMEOS, MAME-Q, and The Everything Console) is a console that is like an all-in-one game console. It can emulate stuff via a plugin on the right side of the console, you can buy plugins for a few dollars each (exact amount undecided). It's basically like a giant USB slot. Speaking of which, there are USB slots on the back side.</p>
